	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) is a bold new venture between the NIH, 10 biopharmaceutical companies and several non-profit organizations to transform the current model for developing new diagnostics and treatments by jointly identifying and validating promising biological targets of disease. Through its Accelerating Medicines Partnership, NIH is helping organize Data Collaboratives among the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies in order to identify promising drug and diagnostic targets for a small set of complicated, currently incurable diseases: Alzheimer’s, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. This new research infrastructure will be established using two interrelated FOAs to support the Network Leadership Center (LC), and the Network Research Sites (RS), which together will form the Network. The Network is defined as the consortium of investigators and institutions funded under both FOAs and will provide the framework for the AMP RA/SLE Program.</div>
