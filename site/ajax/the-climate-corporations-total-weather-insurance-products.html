	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Originally founded as Weatherbill in 2006 by former Google employees, David Friedberg and Siraj Khaliq, the Climate Corporation combines big data, climatology and agronomy to protect the $3 trillion global agriculture industry from increasingly extreme weather with fully automated weather insurance products. After launching its Total Weather Insurance product and authorized to administer federal crop insurance policies in 2013, the company was acquired by Monsanto for $1.1 billion. To enable the development of additional data science driven tools and services to help farmers increase production to meet increasing global demand, the company helped found the Open Ag Data Alliance (OADA), an open source software project to ensure farmers have full data access across different agriculture technology platforms.</div>
