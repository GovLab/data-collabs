	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The PowerSchool Independent Software Vendors (ISV) Partner program promotes the delivery of comprehensive solutions that support the everyday student data management requirements of a classroom, school, district or state. Eligible partners must offer critical, efficient solutions that maximize PowerSchoolâ€™s support of teaching and learning. In support of its ISV program, Pearson makes a deep investment of support for the partner companies as they integrate their solutions with PowerSchool as well resources to help share their stories with school districts nationwide. With application programming interface (API) tools provided by Pearson, PowerSchool can easily be integrated with many software applications to create cost-effective and efficient approaches for school districts. More than 100 education technology companies have joined its ISV program.</div>
