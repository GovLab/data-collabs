	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Wyoming Business Coaliton on Health consists of private and public employers interested in pooling data on healthcare costs for better price transparency and lower costs for healthcare. Members (local businesses) have joined the Coalition. One initiative is the HealthpamRx project. HealthMapRx is a patient-focused collaboration between your employee, a community pharmacist and his/her health care team. The project was first implemented in Asheville, NC and is now being duplicated in Wyoming.</div>
