	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">In February 2014, NOAA issued a RFI to businesses and researchers in order to solicit ideas from the private sector on opening access to its 30 petabytes of annual environmental data from satellites, radars, ships, aircraft, river gauges and weather forecast products. The February RFI focused on developing physical infrastructure for storing and sharing NOAA’s data within a publicly accessible cloud, allowing industry experts and scientists to, for example, extrapolate vast amounts of historical data, schedule satellite launches, and make better predictions. In addition to sharing making more of its data publicly accessible, the agency also aims to recover costs incurred following the opening up of its data sets as a result of the president’s open data executive order in May 2013. After receiving 70 responses from individuals, academia and industry organizations, NOAA developed an initial concept for its big data partnership business model.</div>
