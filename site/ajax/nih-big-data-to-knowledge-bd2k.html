	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">As biomedical datasets become increasingly large, diverse, and complex, they tax conventional methods for sharing, managing, and analyzing data. Additionally, researchersâ€™ abilities to capitalize on biomedical big data science-based approaches are limited by poor data accessibility and interoperability, the lack of appropriate tools, and insufficient training. In November 2014, the NIH launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative as a trans-NIH, community-enabled endeavor towards maximizing the collective value of current and future biomedical digital assets to better inform and protect human health. As stated in the November RFI, the aims of the BD2K initiative are to facilitate broad use of biomedical digital assets by making them discoverable, accessible, and citable; to conduct research and develop the methods, software, and tools needed to fully analyze biomedical big data; to enhance training in the development and use of methods and tools necessary for biomedical big data science; and to enable a data ecosystem that accelerates both basic and translational discovery as part of a digital enterprise.</div>
