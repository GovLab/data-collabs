- description: Global Fishing Watch is the result of a collaboration among Google,
    Oceana and SkyTruth to map and measure fishing activity worldwide. Global Fishing
    Watch is made possible by the availability of data from the Automatic Identification
    System (AIS), used by more than 100,000 vessels worldwide. Global Fishing Watch
    analyzes these data to identify behavior consistent with fishing, and gives citizens
    everywhere in the world the information they need to examine that behavior in
    the context of global fishery management rules and ensure that the government
    agencies responsible for managing commercial fishing fleets are accountable for
    delivering a healthy, diverse and maximally productive ocean.
