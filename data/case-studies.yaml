- description: Propeller Health is dedicated to improving the management of asthma
    for patients and healthcare professionals. Despite advances in our understanding
    of the disease and the development of more effective medications, morbidity and
    mortality from asthma have not declined. Our understanding of asthma has been
    limited by a lack of timely data, and our inability to collect information about
    where and when people develop symptoms. Propeller Health is using inhaler sensors,
    mobile applications, advanced analytics and feedback to help physicians identify
    those patients who need more help controlling the disease before they suffer a
    severe and costly exacerbation.

- description: Global Fishing Watch is the result of a collaboration among Google,
    Oceana and SkyTruth to map and measure fishing activity worldwide. Global Fishing
    Watch is made possible by the availability of data from the Automatic Identification
    System (AIS), used by more than 100,000 vessels worldwide. Global Fishing Watch
    analyzes these data to identify behavior consistent with fishing, and gives citizens
    everywhere in the world the information they need to examine that behavior in
    the context of global fishery management rules and ensure that the government
    agencies responsible for managing commercial fishing fleets are accountable for
    delivering a healthy, diverse and maximally productive ocean.
